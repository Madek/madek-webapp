Analysis - issue #122:

Keywords after searching are additionaly sorted by relevance, and there are four rules which compute the rank needed for sorting mechanism.

The «Schlagworte» meta key contains 9743 keywords, when «Material / Format / Sprache» meta keys contains "only" in quotes 283 keywords,
so there is an obvious situation, that sorting results for the second one are less vulnerable (walnerabl) for edge cases.

In my opinion the solution could be about adding some condition, when the sorting rules are applied at all, I mean when you type a term with length equal or greater than 2 letters. Because the issue happens only for 1-letter term.
