== MAdeK ==

MAdeK is short for 'Medienarchiv der Künste', a project at the Zürich University of the Arts.

The goal is to release a media archival, management and sharing system that can archive
video, audio and image files along with their metadata. The system crowdsources the chore of
retrieving and assigning metadata to the users themselves instead of putting all the burden
on the archival expert.

There isn't much to see here yet as we will only approach version 1.0 towards the
end of 2011.

See you then!


= Installation (for the brave) =

If you want to try to install this, here's some hints (we won't have a complete installation guide
until 2012):

 * Install ExifTool, ImageMagick, Sphinx
 * Grab the MAdeK source
 * Adapt the paths etc. in config/application.rb. You'll have to point at a few binaries as installed
   on your system. 
 * Copy config/development.sphinx.conf_with_pipe to config/development.sphinx.conf and adapt
   the settings.
 * cd into your MAdeK directory
 * Create (or copy from the samples) config/database.yml
 * rake db:create
 * bundle install
 * rake madek:reset

That should get you up and running.
