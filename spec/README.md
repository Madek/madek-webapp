# Manual Checks

Some specs are broken and need to be manually checked (on `staging`)
as the v2 releases are very rare and it would take more time to fix the specs.

- Homepage (Welcome page) can successfully be loaded as guest user
- MediaEntry: Edit MetaData (single): All types of MetaData can be changed at once
    - open entry with lots of MetaData, click Edit
    - change each type (Text, Keyword, Person, User, Group, â€¦)
    - Save and verify result.
