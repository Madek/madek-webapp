# Node Modules Submodule Removal

## Changes Made

Removed `node_modules` from git submodule tracking. This directory should never be version controlled as it contains generated dependencies that can be recreated from `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### What Changed

1. **Removed git submodule**: `node_modules` is no longer a git submodule pointing to `https://github.com/Madek/madek-webapp-node-modules.git`
2. **Added to .gitignore**: `node_modules/` is now properly ignored
3. **Updated .gitmodules**: Removed the node_modules submodule entry

### Why This Change?

**Problems with node_modules as a submodule:**
- Makes it difficult to update dependencies (requires committing to a separate repo)
- Increases repository size unnecessarily
- Complicates the development workflow
- Goes against npm/Node.js best practices
- Makes dependency updates more complex

**Benefits of using npm install:**
- Standard Node.js workflow
- Easy dependency updates with `npm install` or `npm update`
- Smaller git repository
- No conflicts between local and submodule versions
- CI/CD systems can install dependencies fresh each time

## Installation Instructions

### For New Developers

After cloning the repository:

```bash
npm install --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Note:** The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is needed because some dependencies (like `react-day-picker@6.2.1`) don't officially support React 18 but work fine with it.

### For Existing Developers

If you had the old submodule setup:

1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. Update submodules (this will remove the node_modules submodule):
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

### CI/CD Updates

If you have CI/CD pipelines, update them to:

1. Remove any `git submodule update` commands for node_modules
2. Add `npm install --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps` to the build steps

## npm Scripts

All existing npm scripts continue to work:

```bash
npm run build        # Build all bundles
npm run watch        # Watch and rebuild on changes
npm run lint         # Check code style
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix code style issues
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors

**Solution:** Delete `node_modules` and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Issue: Peer dependency warnings

This is expected due to React 18 migration. The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag allows installation despite peer dependency mismatches that are known to be safe.

## Related Changes

This change works in conjunction with the React 18 migration (see `REACT_18_MIGRATION.md`).
