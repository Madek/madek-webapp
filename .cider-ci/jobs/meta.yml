      Tasks that rely on external (out-of-repository) state.
      Their state is not as fixed as in the other Jobs,
      so it might change over time.

    - type: branch
      include-match: ^.*madek-v3.*$

    context:
      task-defaults:
        max-auto-trials: 1

          scripts:

        git_branch_current:
          name: "git tree contains latest commit from origin/HEAD"
