  # https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/24559359 -> Datierung aus Kameradatum (EXIF/IPTC) Ã¼bernehmen (Erstellungsdatum)
  Scenario: Extracting the camera date into metadata
    Given I am pending
    When I upload a file
    Then I want to have the date the camera took the picture on as the creation date

  @javascript
  Scenario: Uploading an MP3 file
    Given I am "Normin"
    When I upload the file "features/data/files/shit_in_my_head.mp3" relative to the Rails directory 
    #When I upload the file "features/data/images/berlin_wall_01.jpg" relative to the Rails directory 
    And I go to the upload edit
    And I fill in the metadata for entry number 1 as follows:
    |label    |value                       |
    |Rechte|Some Random Stuff             |
    And I follow "weiter..."
    And I follow "Import abschliessen"
    And I go to the media entries
    And I click the media entry titled "Shit in my Head"
    Then I should see "Shit in my Head"
    # TODO: Extract this to 'Rechte' or 'Autor/in'
    #And I should see "Bit-Tuner and Kurt Kuene"
