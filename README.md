# Madek

Madek is a media archival, management and sharing system that can archive
video, audio and image files along with their metadata. The system crowdsources the chore of
retrieving and assigning metadata to the users themselves instead of putting all the burden
on the archival expert.

We expect to release version 1.0 in January 2013. 

See you then!
